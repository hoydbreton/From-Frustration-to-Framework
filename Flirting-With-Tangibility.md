Flirting With Tangibility

This single object held such local quality, and value that was far beyond its material, that I had to buy it. I was starting to realize that forgotten or overlooked objects which held a promise impressed me, and they continue to do so.

Ship it is a phrase we use with pride when dealing with software releases. I dig it — it makes me think that we've loaded 5 million units spanned across dozens of shipping containers destined to capital ports. Despite the empowering allusion, the reality of the matter is that what I do is tethered to a screen, to a graphical interface. I love the agility of designing for the screen; however, I'm creating an opportunity to extend my design thinking onto an object. Not necessarily in the vein of the internet of things, but an ordinary object that will add a moment of added comfort to my own life — extendable to others.

One small opportunity for added comfort is this — my fiancée’s toothbrush lays on the soap holder in the bathroom beside my toothbrush. The soap holder has toothbrush holes but only for ultra-slim old-school toothbrushes. We don't want to stash the toothbrushes either, we want them accessible. What if I could 3D print an ordinary carriage for them?

Designers generally do not think to design the “ordinary.” If anything, they live in fear of people saying their designs are “nothing special.” Of course, undeniably, people do have an unconscious everyday sense of “normal,” but rather they try to blend in, the tendency for designer is to try to create a “statement” or “stimulation.” So “normal” has come to mean “unstimulating” or “boring” design.

That's just one opportunity, a minor one but one that presents a minor defeat twice a day. I've been exploring 3D printing services like Shapeways to address these type of opportunities as well as 3D printing software, first Autodesk's 123D Design and now Cinema 4D. 

I thank Naoto Fukasawa and Jasper Morrison for this experience.
