A framework for improvisation allows us to get into the process of making things more easily. Perhaps the most famous example of an imposed framework was created by jazz musician Miles Davis during the recording of his album, Kind of Blue … Davis amassed a stellar group of musicians, and with a loose framework of limitations to focus them but plenty of space for exploration, he knew they would wander with skill and play beyond themselves.

The Shape of Design – Improvisation and Limitations by Frank Chimero

I've never been satisfied with my rate of output regarding personal projects. My professional projects exist in a completely different domain excluded from this dissatisfaction. I always wanted to create more personal projects not to pollute the world with output of arguable utility but as a betterment exercise.

The principal culprit of the restricted output has been repeated bouts of overthought. Overthought crippling momentum based on how conceptually sound or how visually appealing the idea's form has assumed. All mental bullshit of course — as a solution from now on all my projects will use the same code scaffolding, aesthetic treatment, and a complete embrace of the minimum viable product. I'll add sophistication as vital attributes of any project demands it.

Both personal projects I have created assume the most minimal investment in execution without sacrificing public understanding. In regards to basic form, I took on the bare form of a page I drafted for my final interview with the fine folks over at Artsy where I created a sort of mobile resume to assist my interviewers in conversation regarding my history — http://hoydbreton.com/artsy (btw, the interviews were a success however after some thinking, I stayed at my current company). For payments, I adopted PayPal vs a more sophisticated and personally desirable Stripe integration. These are my two active personal projects: Brutally Early Club and Reside. I'm looking forward to introducing the sophistication as needed.

I thank Frank Chimero and Wilfredo Peña for this experience.
