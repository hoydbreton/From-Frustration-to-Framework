Throughout my design career I've come to celebrate the sketching phase more and more — especially while working alongside Luca De Rosso.

The friction I have come across hasn't been in increasing how much I sketch but where I do the sketching and thinking. I've gone through the standard lot of Düller, Rhodia, Behance's Dot Grid, MUCU, and some other designer fare with the White Lines set getting the closest to the right solution. Sadly, after giving all those notebooks a fair shot they fell short in one way or another.

What has been holding up as a solution for some months now has also been the cheapest solution consisting of a 6" x 9" clipboard available in practically any office supply store combined with sheets to properly fit within the clipboard's backing — I pull the A5 sized Fabriano pages in this notebook. The solution lets me pull out relevant sheets and lay them out in a linear fashion to get context across the entire project that I'm focused on as well as lets me easily place them back in order — a rad attribute only really found in the very un-rad 3 ring binders. The solution has also been working very well for my primary assignments as well as side projects. What do you use? What are the benefits? Sling a note to hmbreton@gmail.com

I thank Luca De Rosso for this experience.
